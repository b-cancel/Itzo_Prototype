# Itzo_Prototype
Created for a Game Development Course. 

NOTE: Unfortunately the Unity Web GL Player Doesnt always work, and the game is nearly unplayable because we ran out of time to refine and improve the AI

<h4>Primary Goal:</h4> <h5>Create a game with immersive UI</h5>

<h5>Features Implemented</h5>
<ul>
  <li>semi immersive tutorial</li>
  <li>immersive proximity meter (heart rate is movement speed + monster proximity)</li>
  <li>immersive health meter (communicated through sanity meter communicated through breathing pattern)</li>
  <li>immersive map that still allows for monsters to be hidden in the darkness</li>
  <li>immersive potental health loss or gain (communicated through sound driven light flickering)</li>
  <li>immersive monster behavior (sounds for transitioning between wander, chase sound, and chase sight... and sounds for exisiting within each of those states)</li>
  <li>immersive goal indicator [compass] (flashlight gets brighter and buzzes louder when facing the goal)
</ul>

<h5>Features Left To Implement</h5>
<ul>
  <li>monster AI Behavior rework (sight and sound with multiple variables)</li>
  <li>monster AI spawning and respawning rework (guarantee a path always exists)</li>
  <li>glowing monsters eyes of different colors depending on the monster chasing sound or sight</li>
  <li>map improvements (object scaling and placement improvements)</li>
  <li>heavy sound balancing (difficult given everyones hearing range and awareness in stressful situations)</li>
  <li>tutorial rework (slower movement during initial monster chase instead of no movement, layered sounds fix)</li>
  <li>jump scare feature (when the monster is in the characters flashlight range, the players sees the monster as if they were the player)</li>
  <li>movement speed modifies the point of view (slow = third person view <-> fast = top down view</li>
  <li>green glowing goal replaced with a switch with animation</li>
</ul>
